# Exercise authoring

Practice exercises live in versioned packs under `content/exercise-packs/<pack>/`. The runtime registry (`runtime/datapass_runtime/exercise_packs.py`) validates every pack at import; the extension catalog (`src/exerciseCatalog.ts`) reads the same files for the Practice UI.

## Pack formats

- **Per-language pack**: `manifest.json`, `exercises.json` (public definitions), `grading.server.json` (reference solution + fixtures per exercise id). Example: `sql-lab-v1`, `internal-demo`.
- **Semantic pack**: `manifest.json`, `scenarios.json`, `grading.server.json`. One scenario and one fixture set expand into several language variants (`sql`, `python`, `polars`, `sparklab`, `dbt`) registered as `<scenario>-<language>`. Example: `unified-retail-v1`.

Every exercise needs exactly one visible, and any number of hidden and edge fixtures; the public `visible_checks` / `hidden_check_refs` / `edge_check_refs` must match the private fixture ids. **Run visible** grades only visible fixtures; **Submit** grades all of them. Grading compares complete result rows (`validation`: exact schema, bag semantics, numeric tolerance, optional `ordered`); truncated results never pass.

## Fixture tables

- Single table: fixtures use `input_rows`; the submission reads the table `input`. This works for every language.
- Named tables: declare one `data_context` entry per table (`name`, `columns`, `sample_rows`) and give every fixture `"input_rows": []` plus `"tables": {"<name>": [rows...]}` with exactly the declared tables. Binding per language:
  - SQL: one typed CTE per table (`FROM orders`);
  - SparkLab: the same CTEs plus parser schemas (`spark.table("orders")`); simulated scan statistics use the fixture row counts;
  - Python/Polars: each table is a variable holding a list of row dicts (`orders`), and all of them are in `tables`;
  - dbt drills: not supported (they bind only `ref("input")`); the registry rejects them rather than approximating.
  Names are lowercase identifiers and cannot be a catalog layer (`source`, `bronze`, ...) or a Python grading helper (`display`, `query`, `publish`, `tables`, `input_rows`).
- Python results: `display(rows)` a list of row dicts (or a DataFrame). An empty list has no columns, so pass `display(rows, columns=[...])` when a result can be empty. Keep dates as `YYYY-MM-DD` strings so SQL DATE output and Python strings compare equal.
- Column types are applied with `CAST`, so dates, decimals and empty fixtures stay typed. Allowed: `INTEGER`, `BIGINT`, `DOUBLE`, `VARCHAR`, `BOOLEAN`, `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`, `DECIMAL(p,s)`. Write dates as `YYYY-MM-DD` strings; results serialize dates the same way.
- At most 200 rows per table and per expected result.

## Airflow Lab exercises

Language `airflow`, runtime `datapass-airflow-sim-v1`, truth `simulated`. The learner's solution is an Airflow DAG file; `runtime/airflowlab` parses it (never executes it) and simulates it. There is no `data_context`. Each private fixture has `"input_rows": []`, a `scenario` and `expected` rows:

```json
{"id": "full-load-fails", "visibility": "hidden", "input_rows": [],
 "scenario": {"now": "2026-03-05T12:00:00Z", "outcome": "task_instances", "columns": ["task_id", "state"],
              "tasks": {"choose": {"branch": ["full_load"]}, "full_load": {"fail_attempts": "all"}}},
 "expected": [{"task_id": "choose", "state": "success"}, "..."]}
```

- `now` is the scheduler clock; `unpaused_at` (default `now`) matters with `catchup=False`.
- Task behavior: `duration_seconds` (default 60), `fail_attempts` (try numbers or `"all"`), `sensor_true_after_seconds` (default: never), `branch` (chosen task ids), `condition` (short-circuit result); `by_logical_date` overrides them per run; `latest_run_only` keeps the last run.
- `outcome` selects the graded table: `runs` (logical_date, run_after, data_interval_start/end, run_id, state), `task_instances` (logical_date, task_id, state, try_number, start_s, end_s, in seconds after the run starts), `rendered` (logical_date, task_id, field, value), `edges` (upstream, downstream) or `tasks`. `columns` projects it; keep one projection per exercise when you set `exact_schema`.
- The registry validates every scenario and rejects scenarios on other languages. A scenario naming a task the DAG does not have is a simulation error, so starters must keep those tasks.
- Only grade what the simulator models with Airflow 3 semantics (see `runtime/airflowlab/README.md`); describe the scenario kinds in the public sections, since hidden scenarios are not shown.

## Quality gate

`python scripts/exercise_packs_smoke.py` (CI runtime job) grades every installed exercise through the real worker:

1. the reference solution must pass a full submission;
2. the starter must not pass;
3. each **mutant** in `MUTANTS` must run successfully and still fail. A mutant is the plausible wrong answer the lesson is about (INNER instead of LEFT JOIN, RANK instead of DENSE_RANK, a filter in WHERE instead of ON, ...). If a mutant passes, the hidden/edge fixtures do not discriminate the mistake: add a fixture that does.

When adding an exercise: design the hidden and edge fixtures around the pitfall, compute expected rows by running the reference solution, **review every expected row by hand**, then add at least one mutant.

## Installed packs

| Pack | Language(s) | Exercises | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sql-lab-v1` | SQL | 60 | All 60 donor SQL lab challenges |
| `engine-lab-v1` | SQL, pandas (`python`), Polars, SparkLab | 20 scenarios / 68 variants | Donor engine lab; SparkLab only where its bounded API supports the operation |
| `python-lab-v1` | Python | 12 | Donor curriculum lessons that transform data |
| `de-patterns-v1` | SQL | 16 | Authored data-engineering patterns: typing imported CSV text, CDC dedup, NULL-safe anti-join, gaps and islands, sessionization, ASOF joins, SCD2 ranges, upsert results, data-quality rules, calendar spines, funnels, medians, cohorts, delimited lists, watermarks, COUNT FILTER |
| `airflow-lab-v1` | Airflow (simulated) | 13 | Authored Airflow 3 lessons graded on simulated outcomes: fan-in/fan-out, TaskFlow data dependencies, catchup on and off, weekday cron, CronDataIntervalTimetable data intervals, `ds_add` under the Airflow 3 `@daily` default, retries, an all_done cleanup, a one_failed watcher that fails the run, a branch join, a soft-fail sensor, `default_args` overrides |
| `unified-retail-v1`, `internal-demo`, `sparklab-runtime`, `guided-spark-v1`, `pipeline-design-v1` | mixed | earlier packs | |

Donor content deliberately **not** promoted (grading compares result rows, so these cannot be graded honestly here): syntax-only Python drills (variables, printing, file/JSON I/O, pathlib, type hints), DDL/UPDATE SQL (PK/FK, SCD2), Spark I/O (`SparkSession`, `read.parquet`, `write.partitionBy`), `repartition`, donor Airflow DAG code (Airflow is now taught through the authored `airflow-lab-v1` simulator pack), pandas `validate=` errors, BigQuery `SAFE_DIVIDE` (DuckDB already returns NULL on division by zero), and the DAX, C#, bash, PowerShell, git, cron, Docker, Kubernetes, cloud and gateway tracks. Those belong to reference/cheat-sheet material (the standalone WorkNotebook), not graded Practice.

## Provenance

Record `origin` (`authored` or `migrated`) and a `provenance.source`. `sql-lab-v1` adapts the Datapass `leetcodedataeng` SQL lab (T-SQL rewritten for DuckDB) with newly authored fixtures. Do not import third-party question corpora.

## Known limitation

`grading.server.json` ships inside the VSIX, so a determined learner can read reference solutions and hidden fixtures. Grading integrity is a teaching aid, not an exam control.
